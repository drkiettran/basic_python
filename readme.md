# Introduction
This repository contains instructions and code that I use for teaching
my students programming in Python.

# Pre-requisites
Desired environment:
- Python 3.x
- Some type of Integrated development (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook

# Hello world!
In some system, to run python version 3.x you're required to execute `python3` 
program. Otherwise, by default, such system would run python 2.

Write the first **hello world** program:

0. Begin
1. Be at the home directory of this repository
2. Open a text editor
3. Enter the following text:

    ```python
    greeting_str = 'Hello, world!'
    print(greeting_str)
    ```
   
4. Save the program as `hello_world.py`
5. Open terminal
6. Go to the folder that contains this repository
7. At the prompt, `>`
8. Run this command:

    ```python
    python3 ./hello_word.py
    ```
9. verifying the output on screen as:
